    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Editors note of the online magazine Spiegel presented alarming headlines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Around the \"Neckartor\" in Stuttgart the EU safety limit for fine dust exceeded on 63 days about 42 per cent above the EU safety limit value of 35 micrograms per cubic meter with alarming 50 mg/m3. That's basically more than 2 months of the year (17,2%) that the values are way above the limit. (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The important problem with this exceeding value is, that the health of the population is affected, weather we want it or not. Fine dust attacks lungs, bronchi or mucous membranes. Moreover, it represents the potential of nitrous gases. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Those nitrous gases are provoking headache, dizziness, shortness of breath and in the long run more damage to our health. Extreme values of those gases can even cause strokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Spiegel's meaning that politics seem not to act accordingly the motivation for this research could provide some insight of causes of high fine dust emissions. Hence, the results may provide potentials for new actions.\n",
